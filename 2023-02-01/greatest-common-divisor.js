/* 
Greatest Common Divisor
Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.
The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

console.log(greatestCommonDivisor(30,12),6)
console.log(greatestCommonDivisor(8,9),1)
console.log(greatestCommonDivisor(1,1),1)

    // start at the larger number, loop backwards
    // if x % i and y % i === 0, we found it
    for (let i = Math.min(x, y); i > 0; i--) {
        if (x % i === 0 && y % i === 0) {
            return i;
