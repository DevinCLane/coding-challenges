Review my solution and offer feedback. Find any bugs if they exist. Tell me how I could further optimize the code I've written.

Describe space and time complexity, and define your variables very explicitly. You cannot offer O(n) without saying what `n` is. For example, if you say O(n) you must say "where n is the length of the array", or whatever `n` stands for. Another example would be
Time complexity: O(n/k) for each function call.
Space complexity: O(k+m)

you would say:
Where n is the number of keys, k is the size of the set and m is the number of unique keys.

Walk me step by step through what I should practice saying in an interview to come across as a strong candidate. Start with which clarifying questions I would ask, which solutions I would outline in which order, describe tradeoffs between solutions.

Are there any other solutions I should study? If I were to study only one solution, which would that be?
