**Purpose:**  
This prompt helps you systematically master data structures and algorithms for technical interviews. After solving a challenge, use this prompt to analyze your solution and prepare for interviews.

**Review solution, offer feedback**
Review my solution and offer feedback. Find any bugs if they exist. Tell me how I could further optimize the code I've written. Do so in a way that will help me prepare as a candidate for job interviews.

**Space and time complexity**
Describe space and time complexity, and define your variables very explicitly. You cannot offer O(n) without saying what `n` is. For example, if you say O(n) you must say "where n is the length of the array", or whatever `n` stands for. Another example would be
Time complexity: O(n/k) for each function call.
Space complexity: O(k+m)

you would say:
Where n is the number of keys, k is the size of the set and m is the number of unique keys.

**Communication and clarifying questions practice**
Walk me step by step through what I should practice saying in a technical software engineering interview to set me up for success in solving the problem, to display proper systematic thinking, and to come across as a strong candidate. Start with which clarifying questions I would ask, which solutions I would outline in which order, and describe tradeoffs between solutions. Provide sample phrases or scripts for how to communicate my approach, tradeoffs, and reasoning during an interview.

**Edge Cases & Constraints**
Prompt me to consider and discuss edge cases and constraints relevant to the problem.

**Mistake Analysis**
Help me identify common mistakes or misconceptions for this problem type and how to avoid them.

**Follow-up Questions**
Suggest follow-up questions an interviewer might ask about my solution, and how I might answer them.

**Reflection and Review:**
Are there any other solutions I should study? If I were to study only one solution, which would that be?
