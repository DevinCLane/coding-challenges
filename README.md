# Coding challenges

I do a coding challenge most weekdays. Here is where I openly share my work. 

## Why am I doing this?

Mastery of Data Structures and Algorithms helps us build scalable programs that use computing resources efficiently. Coding challenges are effective ways to hone these skills.

## Source

These challenges come from a variety of sources including Codewars, LeetCode, Leon Noel, textbooks, freeCodeCamp, etc.
