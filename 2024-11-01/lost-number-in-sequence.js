/* 
Lost number in sequence

An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.
Example:
The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
Your function should return the int 5.
If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.
Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

console.log(lostNumber([1,2,3,4,5], [3,4,1,5]), 2, 'Deletion')
console.log(lostNumber([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [1,9,7,4,6,2,3,8]), 5, 'Deletion')
console.log(lostNumber([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [5,7,6,9,4,8,1,2,3]), 0, 'No deletion')
